# RECAP - how Flask works

Your teacher will run these files for you to remind you of the basics of Flask before we start integrating SQL

The order these should be run is as follows:
- hello.py
- variable.py
- list.py
- list2.py


This will allow you to understand:
- how to run a basic hello world app in Flask
- how to return a variable in a view
- how to return a list or other data structure in a view
- how to loop through each list item and display in an html template


Note that html files in Flask should be stored in the Templates folder.
